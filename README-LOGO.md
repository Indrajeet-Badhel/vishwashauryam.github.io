# Logo Setup Instructions

## Vishwashauryam Eagle Logo

The navigation bar is now configured to display the Vishwashauryam eagle logo on the right side.

### To complete the setup:

**Option 1: Save the logo file**
1. Save your eagle logo image (the one with orange/black eagle and "विश्व शौर्यम्" text)
2. Name it: `vishwashauryam-logo.png`
3. Place it in the root folder: `c:\Users\Administrator\OneDrive\Desktop\vs web\`

**Option 2: Use direct image URL**
If you have the logo hosted online, you can replace `vishwashauryam-logo.png` in all HTML files with the direct URL.

### Current Layout:
```
[VIT Logo] ---------- [Home | Gallery | About Us | Team] ---------- [Vishwashauryam Eagle Logo]
  (Left)                         (Centered)                                  (Right)
```

### Files Updated:
- index.html
- about.html
- gallery.html
- team.html
- styles.css

All pages now have the proper structure to display both logos with centered navigation.
